# Age Verification Module

The initial idea is to act as an age verifier, but it can be used in a generic way. The image and text shown are configurable.

The modal shown uses the Ajax modal system provided by the core, so it can serve as a basis for any other modification or as inspiration for a more advanced verification module. The module is simply a way to provide a solution to a technical test. Thank you for taking a look at it!

## Installation

To install the module, follow these steps:

1. Download the module and place it in your site's modules directory.
2. Enable the Age Verification module.
3. Configure the image and text to be displayed in /admin/config/system/age_verification.

## Usage

The Age Verification module will block the screen with the configured image and text until the user clicks on the displayed button. The verification is done through a session cookie.
